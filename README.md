The aim of this project is to identigy mammogram mass as benign or malignant. Several machine learning algorithms and neural networks will be used. At the end, I will do a comparison between all the approaches to see which one gives the best results. 

The first algorithms used is Decision Trees (with and without K-Fold validation) and Random Forest. 

Accuracy of decision trees without K-Fold validation: 75.25%
Accuracy of decision trees with K-Fold validation: 76.75%
Accuracy of random forest with K-Fold validation: 77.22%
