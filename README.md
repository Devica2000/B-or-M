The aim of this project is to identify mammogram mass as benign or malignant. Several machine learning algorithms and neural networks will be used. At the end, I will do a comparison between all the approaches to see which one gives the best results. 

The first algorithms used is Decision Trees (with and without K-Fold validation) and Random Forest. 

Accuracy of decision trees without K-Fold validation: 75.25%
Accuracy of decision trees with K-Fold validation: 76.75%
Accuracy of random forest with K-Fold validation: 77.22%

The second algorithm used is SVM. Used the SVM algorithm for different kernels.
Accuracy with 'rbf' kernel = 80.12%
Accuracy with 'linear' kernel = 79.64%
Accuracy with 'sigmoid' kernel = 73.51%
Accuracy with 'poly' kernel = 79.27%
